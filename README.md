# [WIP] mern-starter-client

## Purpose

* quick start template for mern projects with additional packages I tend to use
  * react router (v4)
  * redux
  * thunk middleware
  * react-loader
  * react-icons

## TODO

* this project will also be supported by mern-starter-server
  * node, mongoose, express


## Resources

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


## Caveats

There is some likelihood that this project may become out of date in the future (some of the dependent npm modules might get upgraded by their maintainers and might not get updated in this project). Sorry if this occurs.
